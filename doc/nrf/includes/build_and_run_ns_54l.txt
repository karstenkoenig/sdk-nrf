This sample can be found under |sample path| in the |NCS| folder structure.

.. note::
   In the initial limited sampling, TrustZone is not available.

In the limited sampling release of the |NCS|, you need to use either the command line or |nRFVSC| to program the nRF54L15 PDK.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Command line

         Complete the following steps to program the nRF54L15 PDK using the command line interface:

         1. Connect the nRF54L15 PDK to your computer using the IMCU USB port on the PDK.
         #. Navigate to the |sample path| folder containing the sample.
         #. Build the sample by running the following command::

               west build -b nrf54l15dk_nrf54l15_cpuapp@soc1

         #. Program the sample using the standard |NCS| command.
            If you have multiple Nordic Semiconductor devices, make sure that only the nRF54L15 PDK you want to program is connected.

            .. code-block:: console

               west flash

            .. note::
                  When programming the device, you might get an error similar to the following message::

                     ERROR: The operation attempted is unavailable due to readback protection in
                     ERROR: your device. Please use --recover to unlock the device.

                  This error occurs when readback protection is enabled.
                  To disable the readback protection, you must *recover* your device.

                  Enter the following command to recover the core::

                     west flash --recover

                  The ``--recover`` command erases the flash memory and then writes a small binary into the recovered flash memory.
                  This binary prevents the readback protection from enabling itself again after a pin reset or power cycle.

   .. tab:: |nRFVSC|

         To build the sample using |VSC|, follow the steps listed on the `How to build an application`_ page in the |nRFVSC| documentation.

See :ref:`gs_programming` for other building and programming scenarios and :ref:`gs_testing` for general information about testing and debugging in the |NCS|.
