This sample can be found under |sample path| in the |NCS| folder structure.

In the limited sampling release of the |NCS|, you need to use either the command line or |nRFVSC| to program the nRF54L15 PDK.

   .. tab:: Command line

         Complete the following steps to program the nRF54L15 PDK using the command line interface:

         1. Connect the nRF54L15 PDK to your computer using the IMCU USB port on the PDK.
         #. Navigate to the |sample path| folder containing the sample.
         #. Build the sample by running the following command::

               west build -b nrf54l15dk_nrf54l15_cpuapp@soc1

         #. Program the sample using the standard |NCS| command.
            If you have multiple Nordic Semiconductor devices, make sure that only the nRF54L15 PDK you want to program is connected.

            .. code-block:: console

               west flash

   .. tab:: |nRFVSC|

         To build the sample using |VSC|, follow the steps listed on the `How to build an application`_ page in the |nRFVSC| documentation.

See :ref:`gs_programming` for other building and programming scenarios and :ref:`gs_testing` for general information about testing and debugging in the |NCS|.
