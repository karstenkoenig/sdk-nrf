This sample can be found under |sample path| in the |NCS| folder structure.

In the limited sampling release of the |NCS|, you need to use either the command line or |nRFVSC| to program the nRF54H20 PDK.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Command line

      Complete the following steps to program the nRF54H20 PDK using the command line interface:

      1. Open a terminal window in the |sample path| directory inside the |NCS| folder structure.
      #. Build the application using the ``west`` command:

         .. parsed-literal::
            :class: highlight

            west build -b nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20_cpuapp@soc1

         If you want to configure your application, see :ref:`configure_application` for additional information.

         After running the ``west build`` command, the build files can be found in :file:`build/zephyr`.
         For more information about files generated as output of the build process, see :ref:`app_build_output_files`.
         For more information on the contents of the build directory, see :ref:`zephyr:build-directory-contents` in the Zephyr documentation.

      #. Connect the PDK to your computer using a USB cable.
      #. Power on the PDK.
      #. Program the application to the kit using the following command:

         .. code-block:: console

            west flash --erase-storage

         This command clears the user information configuration registers (UICR) and the locations for the new images and the application core storage partition memory before programming, which is the recommended approach.

         As an alternative, you can also clear only those flash memory pages that are to be overwritten with the new application.
         With this approach, the old data in other areas will be retained.

         To erase only the areas of flash memory that are required for programming the new application, use the following command:

         .. code-block:: console

            west flash

         The ``west flash`` command automatically resets the kit and starts the application.

         For more information on building and programming with the command line, see the Zephyr documentation on :ref:`zephyr:west-build-flash-debug`.

   .. tab:: |nRFVSC|

         To build the sample using |VSC|, follow the steps listed on the `How to build an application`_ page in the |nRFVSC| documentation.

See :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_debugging` and :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_logging` for information about debugging and logging on the nRF54H20.
