This application can be found under |application path| in the |NCS| folder structure.

In the limited sampling release of the |NCS|, you need to use the command line to program the nRF54H20 PDK.

Complete the following steps to program the nRF54H20 PDK:

1. Open a terminal window in the |application path| directory inside the |NCS| folder structure.
#. Build the application using the ``west`` command:

   .. parsed-literal::
      :class: highlight

      |build command|

   If you want to configure your application, see :ref:`configure_application` for additional information.

   After running the ``west build`` command, the build files can be found in :file:`build/zephyr`.
   For more information about files generated as output of the build process, see :ref:`app_build_output_files`.
   For more information on the contents of the build directory, see :ref:`zephyr:build-directory-contents` in the Zephyr documentation.

#. Connect the PDK to your computer using a USB-C cable.
#. Power on the PDK.
#. Program the application to the kit using the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      west flash --erase-storage

   This command clears the user information configuration registers (UICR) and the locations for the new images and the application core storage partition memory before programming, which is the recommended approach.

   .. caution::
      You should use west to program the nRF54H20 PDK during the limited sampling release.

      Do not use the ``nrfjprog -e`` command to program the nRF54H20 PDK, as it will brick the device.
      Use the ``west flash --erase-storage`` command instead.

   As an alternative, you can also clear only those flash memory pages that are to be overwritten with the new application.
   With this approach, the old data in other areas will be retained.

   To erase only the areas of flash memory that are required for programming the new application, use the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      west flash

   The ``west flash`` command automatically resets the kit and starts the application.

For more information on building and programming with the command line, see the Zephyr documentation on :ref:`zephyr:west-build-flash-debug`.
See :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_debugging` and :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_logging` for information about debugging and logging on the nRF54H20.
