This application can be found under |application path| in the |NCS| folder structure.

.. note::
   In the initial limited sampling, TrustZone is not available.

In the limited sampling release of the |NCS|, you need to use either the command line or |nRFVSC| to program the application to the nRF54H20 or nRF54L15 PDKs.

Building and programming using the command line
===============================================

nRF54H20 PDK
   Complete the following steps to program the nRF54H20 PDK using the command-line interface:

   1. Open a terminal window in the |application path| directory inside the |NCS| folder structure.
   #. Build the application using the ``west`` command:

      .. parsed-literal::
         :class: highlight

         west build -b nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20_cpuapp\@soc1

      If you want to configure your application, see :ref:`configure_application` for additional information.

      After running the ``west build`` command, the build files can be found in the :file:`build/zephyr` folder.
      For more information about files generated as output of the build process, see :ref:`app_build_output_files`.
      For more information on the contents of the build directory, see :ref:`zephyr:build-directory-contents` in the Zephyr documentation.

   #. Connect the PDK to your computer using a USB cable.
   #. Power on the PDK.
   #. Program the application to the kit using the following commands:

      .. code-block:: console

         west flash --erase-storage

      It is recommended to use this command before programming, as it clears the user information configuration registers (UICR) and the locations for the new images as well as the application core storage partition memory.

      As an alternative, you can also clear only those flash memory pages that are to be overwritten with the new application.
      With this approach, the old data in other areas will be retained.

      To erase only the areas of flash memory that are required for programming the new application, use the following command:

      .. code-block:: console

         west flash

      The ``west flash`` command automatically resets the kit and starts the application.

   For more information on building and programming through the command line, see the Zephyr documentation on :ref:`zephyr:west-build-flash-debug`.
   See :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_debugging` and :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_logging` for information about debugging and logging on the nRF54H20 PDK.

nRF54L15 PDK
   Complete the following steps to program the nRF54L15 PDK using the command-line interface:

      1. Connect the nRF54L15 PDK to your computer using the IMCU USB port on the PDK.
      #. Navigate to the |application path| folder containing the application.
      #. Build the application by running the following command:

         .. parsed-literal::
            :class: highlight

            west build -b nrf54l15dk_nrf54l15_cpuapp\@soc1

      #. Program the application using the standard |NCS| command.
         If you have multiple Nordic Semiconductor devices, make sure you connected only the nRF54L15 PDK you want to program.

         .. code-block:: console

            west flash

         .. note::
            When programming the device, you might get an error similar to the following message:

                ERROR: The operation attempted is unavailable due to readback protection in
                ERROR: your device. Please use --recover to unlock the device.

            This error occurs when readback protection is enabled.
            To disable the readback protection, you must *recover* your device.

            Enter the following command to recover the core::

                west flash --recover

            The ``--recover`` command erases the flash memory and then writes a small binary into the recovered flash memory.
            This binary prevents the readback protection from enabling itself again after a pin reset or power cycle.

Building and programming using |nRFVSC|
=======================================

To build the application using |VSC|, follow the steps listed on the `How to build an application`_ page in the |nRFVSC| documentation.
