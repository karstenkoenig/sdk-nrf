This sample can be found under |sample path| in the |NCS| folder structure.

.. note::
   In the initial limited sampling, TrustZone is not available.

In the limited sampling release of the |NCS|, you need to use either the command line or |nRFVSC| to program the nRF54H20 PDK.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Command line

         Complete the following steps to program the nRF54H20 PDK:

         1. Open a terminal window in the |sample path| directory inside the |NCS| folder structure.
         #. Build the application using the ``west`` command:

            .. parsed-literal::
               :class: highlight

               |build command|

            If you want to configure your application, see :ref:`configure_application` for additional information.

            After running the ``west build`` command, the build files can be found in the :file:`build/zephyr` folder.
            For more information about files generated as output of the build process, see :ref:`app_build_output_files`.
            For more information on the contents of the build directory, see :ref:`zephyr:build-directory-contents` in the Zephyr documentation.

         #. Connect the PDK to your computer using a USB cable.
         #. Power on the PDK.
         #. Program the application to the kit using the following commands:

            .. code-block:: console

               nrfjprog --eraseall
               west flash

            It is recommended to use this command before programming, as it clears the user information configuration registers (UICR) and the locations for the new images as well as the application core storage partition memory.

            As an alternative, you can also clear only those flash memory pages that are to be overwritten with the new application.
            With this approach, the old data in other areas will be retained.

            To erase only the areas of flash memory that are required for programming the new application, use the following command:

            .. code-block:: console

               west flash

            The ``west flash`` command automatically resets the kit and starts the application.

         For more information on building and programming through the command line, see the Zephyr documentation on :ref:`zephyr:west-build-flash-debug`.
         See :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_debugging` and :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_logging` for information about debugging and logging on the nRF54H20 PDK.

         To build the sample using |VSC|, follow the steps listed on the `How to build an application`_ page in the |nRFVSC| documentation.

See :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_debugging` and :ref:`ug_nrf54h20_logging` for information about debugging and logging on the nRF54H20.
