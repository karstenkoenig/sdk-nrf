|NCS| delivers reference software and supporting libraries for developing low-power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor products in the nRF52, nRF53, nRF54, nRF70, and nRF91 Series.

This release of |NCS| is only meant to be used for product development on the nRF54H and nRF54L devices.
To work with other devices, use the |NCS| 2.4.0 release from the `sdk-nrf`_ repository.
This release notes document only lists additional changes related to the nRF54 customer sampling v2.4.99-cs2.

The SDK includes open source projects (TF-M, MCUboot, OpenThread, Matter, and the Zephyr RTOS), which are continuously integrated and redistributed with the SDK.

Release notes might refer to "experimental" support for features, which indicates that the feature is incomplete in functionality or verification, and can be expected to change in future releases.
To learn more, see :ref:`software_maturity`.

All features delivered as part of nRF54 limited sampling are experimental.

Changelog
*********

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

Application Development
=======================

* Added support for development on the nRF54L15 and nRF54H20 devices in |nRFVSC|.

Applications
============

This section provides detailed lists of changes by :ref:`application <applications>`.

nRF Desktop
-----------

* Added:

  * Support for the nRF54H20 PDK with the ``nrf54h20dk_nrf54h20_cpuapp@soc1`` board target.
    The nRF Desktop application for this target is configured to act as a gaming mouse.
    It supports both USB High-Speed and the Bluetooth LE transport.
    See the :ref:`nrf_desktop_board_configuration_files` section of the nRF Desktop documentation for details.
  * The :ref:`nrf_desktop_measuring_hid_report_rate` section in the nRF Desktop documentation.
    The USB High-Speed transport on the nRF54H20 PDK is able to achieve 8000 HID reports per second with the shortest USB polling interval.
  * Kconfig options to enable handling of the power management events for the following nRF Desktop modules:

    * :ref:`nrf_desktop_board` - The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BOARD_PM_EVENTS <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.
    * :ref:`nrf_desktop_motion` - The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_PM_EVENTS <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.
    * :ref:`nrf_desktop_ble_latency` - The :ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_BLE_LATENCY_PM_EVENTS <config_desktop_app_options>` Kconfig option.

    All listed Kconfig options are enabled by default and depend on the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CAF_PM_EVENTS` Kconfig option.
  * Kconfig option to configure a motion generated per second during a button press (:ref:`CONFIG_DESKTOP_MOTION_BUTTONS_MOTION_PER_SEC <config_desktop_app_options>`) in the :ref:`nrf_desktop_motion`.
    To improve accuracy of the motion data generated when pressing a button, the implementation relies on the hardware clock instead of the system uptime.

* Updated:

  * To improve the accuracy, the generation of simulated movement data in the :ref:`nrf_desktop_motion` now uses a timestamp in microseconds based on the cycle count (either :c:func:`k_cycle_get_32` or :c:func:`k_cycle_get_64` function depending on the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TIMER_HAS_64BIT_CYCLE_COUNTER` Kconfig option).
  * Aligned Kconfig option names in the :ref:`nrf_desktop_motion` implementation that generates motion from button presses.
    The Kconfig options defining used key IDs are prefixed with ``CONFIG_MOTION_BUTTONS_`` instead of ``CONFIG_MOTION_`` to ensure consistency with configuration of other implementations of the motion module.

nRF Machine Learning (Edge Impulse)
-----------------------------------

* Updated the machine learning models (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_EDGE_IMPULSE_URI`) used by the application so that they are now hosted by Nordic Semiconductor.
