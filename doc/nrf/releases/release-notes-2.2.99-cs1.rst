|NCS| delivers reference software and supporting libraries for developing low-power wireless applications with Nordic Semiconductor products in the nRF52, nRF53, nRF54, nRF70, and nRF91 Series.

This release of |NCS| is only meant to be used for product development on the nRF54H20 device.
To work with other devices, use the |NCS| 2.3.0 release from the `sdk-nrf`_ repository.
This release notes document only lists additional changes related to the nRF54H20 limited customer sampling.

The SDK includes open source projects (TF-M, MCUboot, OpenThread, Matter, and the Zephyr RTOS), which are continuously integrated and redistributed with the SDK.

Release notes might refer to "experimental" support for features, which indicates that the feature is incomplete in functionality or verification, and can be expected to change in future releases.
To learn more, see :ref:`software_maturity`.

All features delivered as part of nRF54H20 limited sampling are experimental.
