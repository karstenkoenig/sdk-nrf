   </select>


.. HOWTO

   When adding a new version, add it to the dropdown list above and move the "selected" option next to it.
   Once "selected" is moved, only issues that are valid for the new version will be displayed when entering the page.

   When updating this file, add entries in the following format:

     Start every sentence on a new line.

     There can be several paragraphs, but they must be indented correctly.

In addition to these known issues, check the current issues in the `official Zephyr repository`_, since these might apply to the |NCS| fork of the Zephyr repository as well.
To get help and report issues that are not related to Zephyr but to the |NCS|, go to Nordic's `DevZone`_.
